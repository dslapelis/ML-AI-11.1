# AI/ML 11.1
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and supporting files for module 11.

## Setup
We use pipenv to control our Python packages. To install pipenv, run the following command
`pip install pipenv`.

You may then set up your pipenv with the required packages by running
`pipenv shell`
`pipenv install`

Setting up your IDE to use these packages will vary.

## Running the notebook
Download the notebook and supporting files to your machine, and upload them to your Jupyter notebook 
or, alternatively, upload them to Google Colab.
